# Chapter 5: Decisions

## Programming Projects

### P5.1: [`Season.java`](./Season.java)

The following algorithm yields the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day.

```py
if month is 1, 2, or 3, season = "Winter"
else if month is 4, 5, or 6, season = "Spring"
else if month is 7, 8, or 9, season = "Summer"
else if month is 10, 11, or 12, season = "Fall"
if month is divisible by 3 and day >= 21
   if season is "Winter", season = "Spring"
   else if season is "Spring", season = "Summer"
   else if season is "Summer", season = "Fall"
   else season = "Winter"
```

Write a program that prompts the user for a month and day and then prints the season, as determined by this algorithm. Use a class `Date` with a method `getSeason`.

### P5.2: [`Horoscope.java`](./Horoscope.java)

Write a program that prompts for the day and month of the userâ€™s birthday and then prints a horoscope. Make up fortunes for programmers, like this:

```
Please enter your birthday (month and day): 6 16
Gemini are experts at figuring out the behavior of complicated programs.
You feel where bugs are coming from and then stay one step ahead. Tonight,
your style wins approval from a tough critic.
```

Each fortune should contain the name of the astrological sign. (You will find the names and date ranges of the signs at a distressingly large number of sites on the Internet.) Use a class `Date` with a method `getFortune`.
