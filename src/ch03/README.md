# Chapter 3: Implementing Classes

### Section 3.5 - [`cash_register/`](./cash_register/)

**Problem Solving: Tracing Objects**

The `CashRegister` class totals up sales and computes change due. 

### IR 3.3 (all) - [`suburban_scene/`](./suburban_scene/)

Complete the `TrafficLight` class to draw a traffic light. Modify the `TrafficLight` class so that the width of the rectangle can be specified in the constructor. The gap between the circles should be 20 percent of the width.

Using the `Car` class from the textbook and your `TrafficLight` class, draw the following scene:

### E3.1 - [`Counter.java`](./Counter.java) ([`undo()`](./Counter.java#42))

Add a button to the tally counter in Section 3.1 that allows an operator to undo an accidental button click. As an added precaution, make sure that clicking the undo button more often than the click button has no effect.

### E3.2 - [`Counter.java`](./Counter.java) ([`setLimit()`](./Counter.java#24))

Simulate a tally counter that can be used to admit a limited number of people. If the click button is clicked more often than the limit, it has no effect.
