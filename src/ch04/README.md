# Chapter 4: Fundamental Data Types

## Practice Exercises

### E4.1 - [`SheetProperties.java`](./SheetProperties.java)

Write a program that displays the properties of a letter-size (8.5 Ã— 11 inches) sheet of paper in millimeters. There are 25.4 millimeters per inch. The program should print:

-   The width and height
-   The perimeter
-   The length of the diagonal

Use constants and comments in your program.

### E4.2 - [`Powers.java`](./Powers.java)

Write a program that reads a number and displays the square, cube, and fourth power. Use the `Math.pow` method only for the fourth power.

### E4.3 & 4.4 - [`Operations.java`](./Operations.java)

Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints

-   The sum
-   The difference
-   The product
-   The average
-   The distance (absolute value of the difference)
-   The maximum (the larger of the two)
-   The minimum (the smaller of the two)

Hint: The max and min functions are declared in the `Math` class.

Enhance the output so that the numbers are properly aligned:

```
Sum:             45
Difference:      -5
Product:        500
Average:         22.50
Distance:         5
Maximum:         25
Minimum:         20
```

### E4.5 - [`Conversions.java`](./Conversions.java)

Write a program that prompts the user for a measurement in meters and then converts it to miles, feet, and inches.
