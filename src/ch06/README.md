# Chapter 6: Loops

## Practice Exercises

### E6.1: [`Sums.java`](./Sums.java)

Write programs with loops that compute

a. The sum of all even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

b. The sum of all squares between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

c. All powers of 2 from $2^0$ up to $2^{20}$.

d. The sum of all odd numbers between a and b (inclusive), where a and b are inputs.

e. The sum of all odd digits of an input. (For example, if the input is 32677, the sum would be 3 + 7 + 7 = 17.)

### E6.2: [`Sequence.java`](./Sequence.java)

Write programs that read a sequence of integer inputs and print

a. The smallest and largest of the inputs.

b. The number of even and odd inputs.

c. Cumulative totals. For example, if the input is `1 7 2 9`, the program should print `1 8 10 19`.

d. All adjacent duplicates. For example, if the input is `1 3 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 2`, the program should print `3 5 6`.

### E6.3: [`StringAnalyzer.java`](./StringAnalyzer.java)

Write programs that read a line of input as a string and print

a. Only the uppercase letters in the string.

b. Every second letter of the string.

c. The string, with all vowels replaced by an underscore.

d. The number of vowels in the string.

e. The positions of all vowels in the string.
